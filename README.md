# Nex.io
Nex.io an end to end distributed system capable of reducing task computation times of various parallel workloads. The system  utilizes mobile android device hardware that users can set up as available, and can be scaled to numerous devices to act as the servers of our system. The nature of the problem revolves around providing a cheap, scalable, and performant alternative to current-day distributed systems available to users. For example, the cost of setting up an entire server or renting from AWS is a high price in itself depending on the scale of the problem, not to mention the cost of the time and resources needed in order to properly manage these servers or understand AWS.

Our solution allows users to reduce task completion time, without the cost of setting up a personal server, or renting from AWS, while still providing performance capabilities to compute the desired workloads within reasonable time periods. Our system is comprised of a client-side Android app, web-server, scheduler, a server, and the backend infrastructure. These components together will capitalize on mobile computing resources that are currently being wasted. Clients are able to use the app on their phone, personalize their settings for CPU consumption, and in real time see the progress of the running workloads.
